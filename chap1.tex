\chapter{Experimental Procedure}

First you have to get some dead tissue (the knack here is in also managing to
avoid a short custodial sentence for grave-robbing). Then you need one of
those crackling things which makes lots of sparks. The work must also be
conducted in a suitable dark and ancient castle, in close proximity to a town
of highly suspicious and pitchfork-wielding peasants.

The remaining experimental procedure and theoretical mumbo-jumbo is left as an
exercise for the interested reader \citep{shelley-1818}.
