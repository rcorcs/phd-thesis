Compilers are programming tools responsible for translating programs in a given source languange to a lower-level target language.
Compilers must preserve the program semantics, i.e., both 
This compilation process must preserve the program semantics, as specified by the source languange, while also 

Compilers are usually organised in \textit{three-phases}: frontend, optimiser, and backend.
The frontend is responsible for parsing, validating and diagnosing errors in the source code.
This parsed source code is then translated into an intermediate representation, which is the LLVM IR in this case.
The optimiser is responsible for doing a broad variety of transformations, that are usually independent of language and target machine, to improve the code's performance.
%The front end parses source code, checking it for errors, and builds a language-specific Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to represent the input code. The AST is optionally converted to a new representation for optimization, and the optimizer and back end are run on the code.
%The optimizer is responsible for doing a broad variety of transformations to try to improve the code's running time, such as eliminating redundant computations, and is usually more or less independent of language and target.
The backend, also known as the code generator, then translates the code from the intermediate representation onto the target instruction set.
It is common for the backend to also perform some low-level optimisations that take advantage of unusual features of the supported architecture.
%Common parts of a compiler backend include instruction selection, register allocation, and instruction scheduling.
