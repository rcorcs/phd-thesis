\section{Merging Identical Functions}

In this section, we will discuss existing optimisations for merging identical functions.
Figure~\ref{fig:example-identical} illustrates how identical functions can appear in real programs.
The first pair of functions, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:example-identical-1-sphinx3}, were extracted from the \texttt{482.sphinx3} benchmark.
The only difference between these two functions is in their parameter type.
However, all pointer types can be considered equivalent since they can be bitcasted in a losslessly way.
These functions are usually produced by copy-and-paste programming, where a given code pattern is copied and then repurposed~\cite{kim04,jablonski10,ahmed15}.
The second pair of functions, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:example-identical-2-gcc}, were extracted from the \texttt{403.gcc} benchmark and they are fully identical.
These functions are part of GCC's backend, where it is common to have code that is automatically generated from a machine description~\cite{muchnick98,kolek13,ghica15}.

\label{fig:identical-example}
\end{figure}

Note, however, that functions can be identical at the IR or machine level without necessarily being identical at the source level.
Figure~\ref{fig:identical-example} shows two real functions extract from the
447.dealII program in the SPEC CPU2006~\cite{spec} benchmark suite.
Although these two functions are not identical at the source level, they become
identical after a template specialization and some optimizations are applied, in
particular, constant propagation, constant folding, and dead-code elimination. 
Specializing \verb|dim| to $1$ enables to completely remove the loop in the
function \verb|PolynomialSpace|.
Similarly, specializing \verb|dim| to $1$ results in only the first iteration
of the loop in the function \verb|TensorProductPolynomials| being executed.
The compiler is able to statically analyze and simplify the loops in both
functions, resulting in the identical functions shown at the bottom of
Figure~\ref{fig:identical-example}.

Identical code is particularly common in C++ programs
with heavy use of \textit{parametric polymorphism}, via template or \textit{auto} type deduction.
